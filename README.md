# cats-par

Parallel has 2 types instead of 1 despite the second type generally
having a canonical instance. This uses an abstract type member
to allow using a single type rather than 2. As suggestions have made
and plans in place for this in cats 2.0 this is an intermediate
solution that will be deprecated upon its release.
